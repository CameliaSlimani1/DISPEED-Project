# Security, Performance, Energy Trade-off for Intrusion Detection Systems - DISPEED Project 

## Project Description 
Drones, when working in swarms, are supposed to gain more autonomy and efficiency during their mission.
Yet, security threats and low energy levels can disrupt the progress
of the mission. The presented work in this paper is part
of a project that aims to propose strategies for deploying
IDSs on swarms of drones. The proposed strategies would
make it possible to achieve, at runtime, a trade-off between
correctly (accuracy) and rapidly (latency) detecting intrusions
according to mission criticality level and traffic load and the
energy and resource (computation and memory) usage of the
ran IDS. For this sake, the project was subdivided into 3
steps:
 1. Forming an exploration space of IDS models ; 
 2. Implementing, optimizing and characterizing them on multiple platforms ;
 3. Proposing online strategies of IDS mapping on
heterogeneous computing elements and memory capabilities
of a single drone.
